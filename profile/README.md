## AP4M (A Place for Misfits/Me)

It doesn't take much to no longer fit into the current tech landscape.

We want to create a space for creatives that are tired of trying to.

We focus on the collaborative part of the creative process - the feeling we get from working with different people in different ways.

Our hypothesis is that great products come from people embedded in a culture that nurtures and excites.

Part living experiment, part playground, part commerical. We work out in the open, unapologetically and sustainably.

We want to find alternatives to the current options for learning, practice, experimentation and reward. 

We can only do this by working with real products and customers.

We love put our soul into products. We accept a little chaos is the antidote to control.

We take risks we can own. We celebrate our mistakes with cake and cookies.

If we succeed, we are no longer misfits... just us, as we were always intended to be.
