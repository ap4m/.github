## AP4M (A Place for Misfits/Me)

It doesn't take much to no longer fit into the current tech landscape. 

We are misfits and proud of it. We often misbehave.

We tried to belong but we've got scars and stories.

We want to create a space for creatives that are tired of trying to find their place.

We deeply value the collaborative part of the creative process - the feeling we get from working with different people in different ways.

Our hypothesis is that great products come from people embedded in a culture that nurtures and excites.

Part living experiment, part playground, part commerical. We work out in the open, unapologetically and sustainably.

We want to find alternatives to the current options for learning, practice, experimentation and reward. 

We can only do this by working with real products and customers.

Out love language is what we create. A little part of us lives in our products. 

We take risks we can own. We accept a little chaos is the antidote to control. We celebrate our mistakes with cake and cookies.

If we succeed, we are no longer misfits... just us, as we were always intended to be in time and space.

We revel in being a work in process (just like this document)
